# Characterization-based Error Mitigation for Quantum Computation - Workshop

This repository contains the code for the workshop on 
Characterization-based Error Mitigation for Quantum Computation.

- For easy use (without installing anything on your machine), we recommend running the notebook at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Qedma/ieee2025-qesem-workshop/blob/main/qesem_lab.ipynb).

- Otherwise, please run main python notebook `qesem_lab.ipynb` to start the workshop using Jupyter Notebook.

- Python package requirements appear at the start of the notebook, including the pip command to install them:

  ```pip install "qiskit>=2.0.0" "qiskit-ibm-runtime>=0.40.0" "qiskit-aer>=0.17.1" "jupyter>=1.1.1" "networkx>=3.5" "matplotlib==3.10.0" "tqdm>=4.67.1" "scipy" "numpy" "qedma-api==0.18.3"```

- For you convenience, requirements can also be installed using poetry from the `poetry.lock` file.

- Solution notebook can be found at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Qedma/ieee2025-qesem-workshop/blob/main/qesem_lab_solution.ipynb) or at `qesem_lab_solution.ipynb`.
